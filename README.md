**AudioAgeEsimationDemo**
===============================

##Note

In fact, this project aims at judging whether a speaker is an adult or a child, but I don't know how to call this function. So I named it "age esimation" demo. :)

##For developers

  1. MainActivity.java is at AudioAgeEsimationDemo/src/com/example/audiorecordtest/MainActivity.java
  2. You can also get to start by reference to AudioAgeEsimationDemo/src/com/example/func/AppAELocalTest.java
