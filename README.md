# AudioAgeEsimationDemo
An android project for age estimation by speech
Note: In fact, this project aims at judging whether a speaker is an adult or a child, but I don't know how to call this function. So an "age esimation" demo. :)

1. MainActivity.java is at AudioAgeEsimationDemo/src/com/example/audiorecordtest/MainActivity.java
2. You can also get to start by reference to AudioAgeEsimationDemo/src/com/example/func/AppAELocalTest.java
